# Companion-Mental-Health-App
It is a mental health tracker app which gives very cool features including A.I. as facial recognition. I'm a final year student and this is my final year project. Also, I have the documentation of the project which includes:
• UML Diagram
• Basic introduction
• Test cases
• COCOMO Model
• Black Book
To access this documentation, send me an email at nileshgade0428@gmail.com. I would appreciate your kind feedback.
